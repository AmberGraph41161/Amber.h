# Amber.h

Header file I use idk.

Amber.h and Amber.cpp is for just general cpp
AmberWin32.h and AmberWin32.cpp is for <windows.h> or the WINAPI thingy

Any constructive criticism would be nice, DON'T BE MEAN PLEASE ;-;
I am just trying to get better at programming no judgement please. We all start somewhere

Again, idk how the licensing thing works but you can go ahead and do whatever you want with my code,
not that I think that anybody would touch my code lol.
